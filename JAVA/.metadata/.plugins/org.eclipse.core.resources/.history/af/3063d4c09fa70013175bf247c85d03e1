	 * Sorts the array items.
	 * The sorting happens by using the same strategy as insertion sort,
	 * but using a gap value to let value move quicker to their correct position.
	 * After a iteration, with gap value N , every Nth value is in correct position,
	 * relative to the  (N - N)th and (N + N)th  value.	
	 *  After this iteration the array is said to be N sorted.
	 * This repeats for each gap value, which eventually drops down to one,
	 * when the sorting essentially becomes a insertion sort.
